# Find the jobs in your network

If a job is posted to LinkedIn or Indeed, it's likely flooded with applications.  It helps to find the jobs that are in your network but not on those boards.

That can be done manually, but with the competition out there it's time to AI power your job search.

Here are some tools to help you data mine your LinkedIn connections for:

* [Step 1: Find the companies in your network](find-companies/README.md)

In this step we'll request a copy of all of your LinkedIn data so that we can mine it.  This is a free service offered by LinkedIn.

* [Step 2: Find their jobs page and open positions](jobs-page/README.md)

In this step we feed the company names from Step 1 into a Python script to get the careers pages and open positions from the companies in our network.

We could do this search with Google, but it's much faster to do the initial research with an LLM.
